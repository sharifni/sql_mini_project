/*Bitmap indexes
Conventional wisdom holds that bitmap indexes are most appropriate for columns having low distinct values--such as GENDER, MARITAL_STATUS, and RELATION.
 This assumption is not completely accurate, however. In reality, a bitmap index is always advisable for systems in which data is not frequently updated 
by many concurrent systems. In fact, as I'll demonstrate here, a bitmap index on a column with 100-percent unique values (a column candidate for primary key)
 is as efficient as a B-tree index.

Oracle's two major index types are Bitmap indexes and B-Tree indexes. B-Tree indexes are the regular type that OLTP systems make much use of, and bitmap
 indexes are a highly compressed index type that tends to be used primarily for data warehouses.

Characteristic of Bitmap Indexes

For columns with very few unique values (low cardinality)
Columns that have low cardinality are good candidates (if the cardinality of a column is <= 0.1 %  that the column is ideal candidate, consider also 0.2% â€“ 1%)

Tables that have no or little insert/update are good candidates (static data in warehouse)
 
Stream of bits: each bit relates to a column value in a single row of table
create bitmap index person_region on person (region);

        Row     Region   North   East   West   South
        1       North        1      0      0       0
        2       East         0      1      0       0
        3       West         0      0      1       0
        4       West         0      0      1       0
        5       South        0      0      0       1
        6       North        1      0      0       0

Advantage of Bitmap Indexes

The advantages of them are that they have a highly compressed structure, making them fast to read and their structure makes it possible for the system to
 combine multiple indexes together for fast access to the underlying table.
